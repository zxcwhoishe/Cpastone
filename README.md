 # NOTE: By default, you do not need to do any camera scripting in OpenHD !
# Only for advanced users !
# The custom unmanaged camera service executes this script with root when enabled.

# For reference, here again: To use this functionality, set either primary or secondary cam to custom unmanaged -
# after that, you can pipe rtp h264 data to localhost::5500 (primary) / localhost:5501 (secondary) via gstreamer pipeline(s)
# (h265,mjpeg if you set the custom unmanaged cam to h265,mjpeg via qopenhd).
# but you loose functionalities like variable bitrate, changing the resolution via qopenhd and more.

# Example setup IP camera as primary camera.
# 1) Setup rpi ethernet as dhcpcd provider
# 2) launch a pipeline streaming data via gstreamer to openhd for transmission
